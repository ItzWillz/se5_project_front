# Tutorial Frontend in Vue 3

This application allows users to create and maintain a list of tutorials that can have multiple lessons within. Please visit https://github.com/OC-ComputerScience/tutorial-backend for the backend repository.

#### Please note:

- This project utilizes **Google Authentication** to allow users to log in.
- You will need to provide a **Client ID and Client Secret from Google** for this project to run locally.
- You will need to provide a **Refresh Token** generated through the **Google Developers OAuth 2.0 Playground** for Cypress testing to work.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the project into your **XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs** directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/OC-ComputerScience/tutorial-frontend-vue3.git
```

2. Install the project.

```
npm install
```
3. Install cross-env to allow correct use of .env files.

```
npm cross-env
```
4. Make sure **Apache** is running.

   - We recommend using XAMPP to serve this project.
   - In XAMPP, make sure that **Apache** is running.

5. In order to make the Google authentication work, have a project registered with the **Google Developer console**.

   - https://console.developers.google.com/
   - Enable **Google+ API** and **Google Analytics API**.
   - Enable an **OAuth consent screen**.
   - Create an **OAuth client ID**.
   - Save your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** in a safe place.

6. In order to make the **Cypress testing** work, get a **Refresh Token** for your Google application through the **Google Developers OAuth 2.0 Playground**.

   - https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/
   - Click the gear button on the right.
   - Check **Use your own OAuth credentials**.
   - Configure the Playground to use your Google project's **client ID** and **client secret**.
   - On the left, find Google OAuth2 API v2 and check all three items.
     - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email
     - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile
     - openid
   - Click **Authorize APIs**.
   - Click **Exchange authorization code for tokens**.
   - Save the generated **Refresh token** in a safe place.

7. Add a local **.env** file and make sure the **client ID** and **client secret** are the values you have registered with Google and that the **refresh token** is the value you generated through the OAuth 2.0 Playground.

   - VITE_APP_CLIENT_ID = '**your-google-client-id**'
   - VITE_APP_CLIENT_SECRET = '**your-google-client-secret**'
   - VITE_APP_REFRESH_TOKEN = '**your-google-refresh-token**'
   - VITE_APP_CLIENT_URL = 'http://localhost:8081'
   - VITE_APP_API_URL = 'https://accounts.google.com/gsi/client'

8. Compile and run the project locally.

```
npm run dev
```

9. Test your project.
   - Note that your frontend and backend must be running for testing to be successful.

```
npm run test
```

10. Test your project and watch the tests run with Cypress.

```
npm run test:open
```

11. If you are wanting to serve your project for production:
    - You will need to have a **.htaccess** file.
    - It should be in your **public** folder.
    - Visual Studio Code will auto format it to where the file will not be read correctly, so add the following rule to your **settings.json** in Visual Studio Code.

```
"files.associations": {
    "**/*.htaccess": "plaintext"
},
```

12. (Optional) Compile the project for production.

```
npm run build
```

13. (Optional) Lint and fix the project files.

```
npm run lint
```
